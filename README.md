# Todo App with Next.js and React Query

This is a simple Todo application built with **Next.js**, **React Query**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The data is managed locally using a mock API, but the structure is designed to easily integrate with a real backend.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a title.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Optimistic Updates**: The app uses optimistic updates for a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
